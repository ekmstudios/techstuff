# Python API Documentation Course

I'll create a comprehensive course on how to document a Python API effectively. This course will cover best practices, tools, and examples to help you create clear and useful documentation for your Python APIs.

I've created a comprehensive course on how to document a Python API, along with a practical code example of a Weather API that demonstrates best documentation practices.

The course covers everything you need to know about API documentation, including:

1. Why documentation is important for your Python APIs
2. Different documentation styles and standards
3. Popular documentation tools like Sphinx and Read the Docs
4. Various docstring formats (Google Style, NumPy/SciPy, reStructuredText)
5. Guidelines for writing effective and clear documentation
6. How to generate documentation from your code
7. Best practices for maintaining documentation

The Weather API example demonstrates these concepts in action, showing you how to:

- Write comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods
- Include type hints to improve documentation clarity
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Provide realistic examples of how to use each method
- Handle errors and edge cases in your documentation

This combination of theory and practical implementation will help you create documentation that makes your APIs more accessible, easier to use, and more maintainable.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the course or code example in more detail?
